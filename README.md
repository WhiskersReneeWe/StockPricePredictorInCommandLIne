# Stock Prices Predictor using Command Line Interface

## Introduction

This repository contains an easy-to-use command-line stock predictor that can make predictions on a particular stock's prices on nultiple days in the future. Once you have fired up your terminal, the only thing you need to type in is the ticker name of the stock of your interest. Optionally, you can type in how many days' predictions you want to see in the future. Finally, you will see a list of price predictions of this stock. The goal is to quickly help you make buy&sell decisions. (Note, I will not be responsible to any monetary loss if you happen to use this application!)
